This is an unfinished, but fully functional, project of mine (for CheatersUtopia, hence CUbot) which I am now releasing to the public because I have no intention of taking it any further. The features include:
	- Traditional wallhack
	- Name and distance ESP with faded effect when hidden
	- Autoshoot and autosight
	- Customisable radar
	- Target information display
	- No recoil
	- Aimbot
		= Instant aim
		= Curved human aim (uses sine wave) - includes options for frequency, amplitude and speed
		= Velocity based prediction
		= Aim priorities and vectors
		= Aim keys
		= Customisable FOV (field of 'view')

These are the features I was intending to add (had I finished it), in case anyone wants to complete it:
	- Hitbox based aimbot
	- Chameleons and coloured models
	- Logarithmic spiral based human aim (worth a try)
	- Kill/death statistics (already there, just nothing happening with them)

Do what you like with this source code, but please credit me if you release anything with it.

Credits go to both RainerStoff and dom1n1k, check the source files for more information.

You will need MS Detours v1.5 to compile this!
